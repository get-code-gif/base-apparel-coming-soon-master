## Overview

This is a solution to the Base Apparel coming soon page challenge on Frontend Mentor. The page includes a form where users can enter their email address to receive updates about the product launch.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - The `input` field is empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly

## My process

1. I started with a mobile-first approach, designing the layout for smaller screens before scaling up to larger devices.
2. I used semantic HTML5 markup to ensure the structure of the page was meaningful and accessible.
3. I implemented CSS custom properties for consistent styling and easier theme management.
4. I utilized Flexbox for layout and alignment, ensuring the design was responsive and adaptable to different screen sizes.

### What I learned

This challenge helped me improve my skills in form validation using JavaScript. I learned how to use regular expressions to validate email formats and provide user feedback through error messages and icons.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log("ðŸŽ‰");
};
```

### Continued development

Using JavaScript for form validation is an area I want to continue developing. I plan to explore more complex validation scenarios and enhance user experience with dynamic feedback.

### Useful resources

- [Regular Expressions for Email Validation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions/Cheatsheet) - This MDN resource provided a comprehensive guide to regular expressions, which was instrumental in implementing email validation.
